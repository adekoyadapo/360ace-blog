IT infrastructure architectural diagrams are an important aspect of designing and documenting the intended infrastructure. These diagrams allow teams to visualize complex ideas and communicate those ideas in a simple and visual way. Over the years, I have leveraged IT architectural diagrams to conceptualize business requirements and definitions to actual and more practical technical overview so as to have a proper interpretation of the ideas of executives. Here we will dive into some of the best tools for creating IT infrastructure architectural diagrams.

## 1. [Microsoft Visio](https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/microsoft-365/visio/flowchart-software/)
